# Flood Prediction
Flood prediction is a difficult problem. This repo represents code for the 2024 NeurIPS workshop proposal paper submitted to the workshop "Tackling Climate Change with ML"

Flood prediction is difficult because there are very sparse true positive observations. The proposal paper outlines a method to first establish a baseline in Kenya 
and then to leverage pretrained models to generate more training points. With these additional training points, deep learning theory suggests that higher order models 
(i.e, neural networks) can be more appropriately used.
